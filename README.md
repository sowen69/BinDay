BinDay - A Windows Mobile App

Recycling your waste is a great thing! But, with more and more bins, bags and crates to sort it into AND different collection schedules for each one, remembering which bin is being collected on which day can be a challenge, and in some areas you can even be fined for putting your bin out to early.
Bin Day to the rescue – the Bin Day app shows you at a glance your next waste collection day along with which color and type of bin to put out for empting.

·  Choose color and type (wheelie, crate, bag)

·  Enter the next time that bin is due to be collected – Bin Day does the rest
·  Unlimited number of bins.
